The bikeshare system has far more subscriber users than customers and dependent users combined.
This depicts a loyalty view in terms of users assuming subscribers are customers who use the bikeshare service regularly for their daily commute.
The customer services dept. at bikeshare should be looking to have rewards for long term subscribers and looking to advertise more on especially the health and economic, not to mention the environmental benefits of using the bikeshare services.


Q3 Who uses the bikeshare services more by gender (irrespective of age) to improve tailured services and match benefits?

The bikeshare service is used far more by males compared to females.
More than 3/4 of the users of the bikeshare services are male users and just under a 1/4 are female user.
In an ever changing world, the bikeshare system needs to accommodate more female users by maybe looking at female attractive packages -
- Colors of their bikes (pink)
- Have tricycles that can accommodate a child
- Have a grocery busket for home shopping and 1st for women rewards systems
- Maybe organize a special with station based stores for discounts on female products (e.g. sanitary towels)
